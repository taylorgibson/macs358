    "\n",
    "In the code cell below write a function named `multiplicative` that implements the multiplicative cipher.\n",

    "**Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The function must be named `multiplicative` exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The function must have exactly 4 input argurments:\n",
    "  * argument 1: a string that can represent either plaintext or ciphertext\n",
    "  * argument 2: an integer that represents the key for the cipher\n",
    "  * argument 3: a boolean optional keyword argument named `encipher`, set to `True`, that controls if the function will encipher or decipher the string passed to argument 1. `True` should trigger enciphering, `False` should trigger deciphering.\n",
    "  * argument 4: a string optional keyword argument named `LETTERS`, set to `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` that specifies which alphabet your messages will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The function should have a `docstring` defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The function must return a string:\n",
    "  * If the function receives an invalid multiplicative key for the size of the alphabet, the returned string should be exactly `'Invalid Key'`.\n",
    "  * Otherwise, the string returned should represent either plaintext or ciphertext (depending on the `True/False` value of argument 3)\n",
    "     - The string should be formatted appropriately for the type of message it represents\n",
    "     - plaintext should be lower-case letters and no spaces\n",
    "     - ciphertext should be upper-case letters and blocked into character groups of size 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "  * `char_to_int`\n",
    "  * `int_to_char`\n",
