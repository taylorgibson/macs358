# Introduction to Cryptography
## Warmup Activity

To get you started, take a look at the following message on which a crypography method has been applied to conceal its meaning. See if you can systematically work to reveal the original message. Take notes as to what clues you were able to use to help decipher the message. You may wish to print out the text, as making notes or markings on the ciphertext can often help organize your thoughts.

*Hints:*
1. How might the lengths of words be helpful?
2. Can you figure out which letters are supposed to represent vowels? (They are usually used in predictable ways)
3. How might punctuation provide clues about the origial words?
